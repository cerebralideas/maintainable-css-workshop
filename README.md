I'm also on Slack and HipChat!

## Instructions

1. Please fork from https://github.com/cerebrl/maintainable-css-workshop
2. Clone to your local computer
3. Go to www.jsbin.com or your favorite live code editor
4. Copy the starter code from here to the editor and follow the instructions

## Ready? Okay, let's get started!

The challenges are within the project directories. The `-starter.*` files are meant to be copied and pasted into a live code editor with output. I recommend [Mozilla's Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org), but any other live-output producing, code editor is fine.

The brief instructions are found in the CSS file within a comment. If you want more information regarding each challenge, you can refer to the `_docs` directory to find slightly more in-depth discussion and hints for solving the challenges.

There are also demos of how to solve a few of the challenges in a slightly different context for ideas. These use the same techniques and can often inspire the solution.

Lastly, once you are done with all your challenges, you can see if your solution was similar to mine by going into the `_answers` directory for the full solution. But, don't cheat! Really push yourself, and see how far you can get. Good luck!

#### As always, ask me anything :)
