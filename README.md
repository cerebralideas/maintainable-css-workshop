I'm also on Slack and HipChat!

## Instructions

1. Please fork from https://github.com/cerebrl/maintainable-css-workshop
2. Clone to your local computer
3. Go to www.jsbin.com or your favorite live code editor
4. Copy the starter code from here to the editor and follow the instructions

## Ready? Okay, let's get started!

The challenges are within the project directories. The `-starter.*` files are meant to be copied and pasted into a live code editor with output. I recommend [Mozilla's Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org) or [JSBin.com](http://jsbin.com/). 

The brief instructions are found in the CSS file within a comment. If you want more information regarding each challenge, you can refer to the `_docs` directory to find slightly more in-depth discussion and hints for solving the challenges.

#### As always, ask me anything :)
